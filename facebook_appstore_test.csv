507,"Since the last update, three days ago, the formatting does not fit my iPhone. If I click on a post, I can‚Äôt read it, I can just see the pictures. If I‚Äôm playing a game, links, I need to click at the bottom are off the bottom of the screen, and I can‚Äôt even see them. Please fix this.",2
93,I‚Äôm sure we have been hacked once or twice our lives but this is ridiculous that there‚Äôs no support to recover your account. I‚Äôve tried literally everything that you guys have told me to.I‚Äôve been hacked and locked out for about a week. My daughter‚Äôs Instagram was hacked and now there‚Äôs fourFake accounts made of her posting all sorts of crazy stuff. I guess this is a great wake up call. But really you should be better at protecting your users.,2
6,"So annoyed and over Facebook. It‚Äôs so boring and actually pretty annoying. Market place is ridiculous anymore, constant bombardment from instgram ads, can‚Äôt contact anyone if anything messes up, and I mean it‚Äôs pretty boring and dead anymore. My fb got hacked, did EVERYTHING fb said to get it back, but because there‚Äôs NO ONE TO TALK TO I lost EVERYTHING. Because fb has such terrible security they took my account like nothing. I absolutely HATE Facebook. Such crap. No amount of updates will fix this. There‚Äôs a huge reason it‚Äôs rated under 3 stars and was at 1  recently.",2
245,"FACEBOOK IS THE MOST HYPOCRITICAL APP AND POSSIBLY THE WORST SOCIAL MEDIA APPS PERIOD this is supposed to be a ""Open opinion"" no judgment for conversations or debates or just a fun app to share memes and stay connected with friends and family however you use it might I say may cause you to be ""Blocked"" for either several hours the first couple times of being
""Warned"" by Facebook if they take down one of your posts for whatever reason they pick (For no apparent reason) and you will start off with a few hours to a few days or even
MONTHS and I believe some get their account deleted completely because of Facebook disagreements on peoples posts and you may think ""Hm I don't post nothing bad"" or ""That won't happen to me"" trust me there will be one post and you will share it and Facebooks very hypocritical self will take down your posts and even block you account meanwhile for Facebook being so ""Wanna keep Facebook a safe place"" | see a lot of disturbing and down right horrible things online (people dying, accidents, cartel videos of people getting chopped up, Drugs, fights) and just way more than you can ever think you'd see on a app that apparently wants to keep everyone safe why not worry about the posts that you should be worrying about I have been blocked for quite a while now and soon will be ""Unblocked"" for weeks finally and am now writing a review before deleting this app.",2
90,This app is full of hate and bigotry and Facebook is too busy targeting the stupidest of things to give people bans such as liking too many pages in a short time but leaves up comments from people trying to convince people to kill themselves and promoting suicide. It allows comments that incite violence. It even allows comments of people admitting to abuse of both people and animals. I‚Äôve seen more videos of people dying and animals being hurt on here than I care to stand in my entire life. It‚Äôs awful. I guess it really shows what Facebook is fine with and what it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs disgusting.,2
335,Why can‚Äôt the scammer accounts get BANNEDü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ They FLOOD the comment section of every trending post with their false video links and advertisements just to steal information‚Ä¶ can Facebook not shut down accounts who get reported at least 3 times for scamming?! They‚Äôre in the messages too‚Ä¶ trying to get information and whatnot. This needs to be stopped. They‚Äôre TAKING OVER and soon the app will be filled with bots and hackers.,2
172,"I lost one account a long time ago. It said I had to change my password so I did. It logged me out and I went through the process. I went to sign in with the new password and it said email was incorrect. That was my only email at the time. It wouldn‚Äôt let me do anything. 

This time some things got posted by my page that I didn‚Äôt post. I went through the process to remove the things that I didn‚Äôt post and changed my password. When I tried to sign in, it took me through the whole process again like nothing saved. I had to choose another password even though I just changed it then check all recent friends, comments, and posts again. It wouldn‚Äôt let me get passed it until I did it all on the actual web browser.",2
325,My account was disabled no reason and no explanation. I was asked for identification for birth certificate or social number or driver license. I follow instruction I choose to send my birth certificate then it is not working no call contact Facebook tech support at all. I was disabled twice in week row. I just got fb account back two days ago then yesterday‚Äôs it is disabled I am upset !!,2
291,"It‚Äôs sad how the functionality of fb has eroded over the years - sure hope Zuck rights the ship I use it all the time and between the fake profiles posting ridiculous spam + fb app crashing or like right now it‚Äôs not functioning on my laptop 

‚ÄúSorry, something went wrong‚Äù we‚Äôre working to get this fixed as soon as we can",2
483,"i‚Äôve used facebook an embarrassingly long time and i‚Äôm sure of one thing: the app hasn‚Äôt improved.  you think a computer scientist with 20 years of experience under his belt would know how to deliver a nice app but nope!  half the posts are ads, the ux is extremely clunky, i only use it when it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs birthday or someone died!  don‚Äôt get me started on how facebook has boosted misinformation to incite hate crimes against minorities!  remember when tiktok was under fire a few weeks ago for accusations of selling user data to the chinese?  don‚Äôt fret!  facebook has been doing that AND MORE for years!  i hope this app burns to the ground.",2
154,I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug or crash- whatever it is; but I used to be able to scroll quickly up and down my Facebook feed and now it takes forever to just scroll down like I have to scroll at a snail pace which is ridiculous. Please get that fixed.,2
182,"if or when we get a friend's or messge rquest from someone we don't no- could we get a button: ""i don't know this person"" on anything whatever request u'd get? but, then, hopefully whoever created facebook/messeger would get something from if or whenever anyone on facebook and/or messeger has a request from someone they don't no then theire button would go straight to whoever created facebook

502,"Problem 1: I have 30+ ‚Äúliked you‚Äù and 50+ friendships. There should be an option to see all and filter by location. Some of the ppl are not even in my city but I have to go through each one individually to reject until I come across someone that is.

Problem 2: There should be a way to see all messages left on pictures instead of only seeing it while your matching.",2
509,"Update: 
My amazing grandmother has passed away and my family and myself have tried for months to memorialize her account, but every single time it says there‚Äôs an error and it was unable to process request. We did everything it ask and show proof but it just doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm done with this app.
Original review: 
 If I take a picture on Snapchat and upload it to Facebook the quality is horrible. It looks half decent if I upload it to Instagram first. Facebook destroys the quality of pictures and videos.",2
10,"There should be an option to see memories on our feed. I don‚Äôt want to keep cringing at anything I posted years before. 

Y‚Äôall are truly garbage. There‚Äôs no way I reported a clearly racist comment and whoever was responsible for taking down comments like that says it doesn‚Äôt go against Community Standards. Probably part of why y‚Äôall are down to two stars now.",2
464,"Ever since latest upgrade the news feed on my iPhone app does not load any news! It keeps telling me ‚ÄòI‚Äôm all caught up and to check back later‚Äô! I‚Äôve tried uninstalling app, rebooting iPhone, making sure I have right internet speed, logging out and yet nothing is fixing this issue.

377,"I can‚Äôt upload Reels longer than 30 seconds, my Instagram stories stopped syncing to my Facebook profile‚Äôs stories, and nothing I‚Äôve tried to fix it works. I‚Äôve submitted help requests to both platforms numerous times, deleted and reinstalled, checked and doubled checked my settings on both sides, searched tirelessly online for solutions and it‚Äôs till not working. Please help me, this is my last resort - I don‚Äôt want to leave a terrible review but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. üòî",2
30,"You can‚Äôt enjoy Facebook without being restricted for small things, like sharing post, liking post or receiving too many likes.  I could understand being restricted/blocked for bullying etc. but being restricted from using a platform for exactly what it was created for is crazy. I miss the time when you could be yourself on Facebook/Instagram. When you can share as much as you wanted and if you get tired of seeing someone you snooze them for 30 days. These new rules etc. doesn‚Äôt even target the real problem or bullies. It‚Äôs like Facebook became the bullies. Criticizing people for every little thing.",2
210,"I an very displeased with facebook support. If your account gets hacked and there‚Äôs no way to get back into your account because the hacker changed your email and password, kiss your account and anything personal you had in it goodbye because facebook doesn‚Äôt help in this area and it‚Äôs sad. Someone is using my account and scamming people from it. I just want the account deleted so my name won‚Äôt be on the line and Facebook WONT HELP!!üò§",2
255,"1. Why do I need a credit card for the update
2. I would like for polls to have notifications to when a vote came in or how many votes happened the last 24 hours. If something like this exists please tell me I would appreciate it because, I have not found anything on how to do it.
I like your app I use it weekly",2
167,"The only thing that I care about on this app is the marketplace feature, with is often loaded with sponsored postings and fails to load the entire page. If you add filters to your search the app hides postings from you, or refuses to load more than 1/3 of results.",2
84,My Facebook account was hacked and the hacker has been trying to scam people with my information for over a month. I have been completely unable to take the accounts back and there is zero support or ability to reclaim or take down the account. I have even received emails from Facebook stating that the account ‚Äúdoes not violate guidelines‚Äù. There is no way to access anything or talk to anyone about this issue. Don‚Äôt use Facebook,2
140,I like it it‚Äôs okay but one thing that got me mad was I tried to use Facebook marketplace for the first time messages someone about a car and I got a ban for violating the guidelines and all I did was ask if it was available that was all then I send them the why I felt it was a mistake and they fixed it by that time the car was sold . Then I posted a pair of shoes I wanted to sell they took it down and said I was selling tabaccoo products when it was a picture of. Shoes saying they where a size 4 in boys size 5 in girls . This app is so dumb and for that I won‚Äôt be using it,2
148,"When I switch to Facebook and I have absolutely nothing playing in it, why does it pause my music?? THE ABSOLUTELY MOST ANNOYING. The only option is to quit the app. It seems to persist when I *had* played an ad or some media inside Facebook long ago. App seems to think something is still on unless I force quit beforehand. This has been an issue thru many updates. Who dunnit? ‚Äî AND WHY IS IT SO HARD TO EXIT A VIDEO. swipe down? Doesn‚Äôt work Swipe left???? Oh I have to press the little (v) arrow up top on the right. Please Get To Work",2
234,I‚Äôm still unable to commet on posts as of last month cause app crashes once I get in comment section‚Ä¶.I asked u before in order to fix this problem asap &reported it vefore &u ain‚Äôt done jack‚Ä¶.I tried once again reporting issue &reinstalling‚Ä¶.I swear I‚Äôm sick of wasting my breath‚Ä¶.pls fix asap‚Ä¶.I asked before‚Ä¶.pls be considerate of all users‚Ä¶.thx‚Ä¶.,2
272,You literally can‚Äôt delete a Facebook account at all. They make it so difficult it‚Äôs made me hate this app. Like I literally got hacked into and I haven‚Äôt used my account in years. My relatives had to tell me and now I can‚Äôt even delete my stupid account because Facebook makes it a whole maze just to do something that‚Äôs supposed to be simple,2
79,"This app is invasive. It sells our metadata Way too many Bots. too many hackers and they violated my right to speech, shutting my account down numerous times I was unable to communicate with family and friends, because I simply stated my opinion in a public domain. They have an agenda, and they are biased . blacklisting people. And the last thing I really don‚Äôt appreciate how they sell our information.",2
386,"Who even is checking the ads? For some reason every time I post an ad it‚Äôs rejected. Like it‚Äôs a scam or something. All I‚Äôm trying to do is sell Mother‚Äôs Day necklaces. I‚Äôve made new ads and I have emailed customer support but no luck. This is frustrating and I don‚Äôt understand why Facebook is so difficult. This is ridiculous, seriously. Not only is the platform confusing, but the help articles DONT help and apparently neither does the software. If you want to protect people from actual scams, learn what to look for. Understand what counts as a scam. Your ruining people‚Äôs business and wasting their money. I‚Äôd give this zero stars if I could. Hopefully someone who works for customer support sees this and ACTUALLY decides to reach out and help me.",2
403,"If you say anything about r*pe, k!ll, or if you cuss. It‚Äôll immediately kick you off without hesitation. I understand certain words but it just keeps getting more strict every year. Yes I realize those words aren‚Äôt always good to use. But when someone just trying to explain a story or something. I can handle not cussing but when it comes to k!Ll and r@pe well that happens everyday and people are limited to how they can get the story through. Now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where you have to know what their meaning by saying SA of whatever. The app is also very glitchy if I try to reply to someone it‚Äôll send me the notification but if I tap on it. It only leads me to the video not the comment itself. I don‚Äôt understand why I have to look for the comment. At the very least don‚Äôt show the notification so I don‚Äôt have the urge to reply.",2
238,"I recently (two months ago) created a second page. I was able to go back and forth from the both pages with no problem. 
All of sudden I am not getting the notifications for second page and I can see at the top where you have the option to switch the profile pages that I am not able too! Huge issue because I started another page for business and now I can respond to my other notifications! Did the update and my phone is running like crap! Uninstalled the app and reinstalled and still not work! This is a huge issue! üò°",2
426,"I have been trying to get a response from Facebook for more than 10 months. They claim Professional Mode is available to all users but it isn't an option for my account currently. 

I have reported the issue more than 15 times and they have still not fixed my account or responded over a long period of time. I even filed a BBB report- still, no fix/ no response. Not very professional to make claims of features for all falsely, ignore customer raised issues completely and fail to fix or acknowledge issues entirely.  

False marketing and absolutely no customer service support (0/zip/none). Awful company.",2
173,"I hate the new Facebook Watch format. It skips to another video before the first is finished. You can also see part of the next video at the bottom of the screen, which makes the video I want to see smaller. It‚Äôs honestly a distraction from the video I want to watch. All of the garbage at the bottom of the screen also takes up a quarter of the screen and  blocks the captioning at the bottom of videos. It‚Äôs becoming less accessible for the hard of hearing and less enjoyable as a whole.",2
334,"I love using Facebook marketplace and have bought and sold many things on there but now there‚Äôs so many scams and fake users trying to contact via marketplace and they‚Äôre getting more and more clever, trying to have a full conversation with you etc. please add more security and detection so this great feature can be more usable.",2
9,"Facebook will restrict you account for saying; good you got bit, after an animal abuser repeatedly kicked a dog right in the face ; they allow the videos to stay online saying they don‚Äôt go against their community standards BUT if you say good you got bit your account gets restricted;Facebook promotes animal cruelty because no matter how many times you report it they still say it didn‚Äôt go against their community standards I think China owns Facebook that‚Äôs why there is no more free speech on Facebook yeh ok",2
499,"The last update changed how group posts are displayed from the group‚Äôs main view. If I click on a particular group, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúGeneric Group Name‚Äù the app only shows me two posts. I have to scroll to the bottom of the group twice and then a button appears that allows me to load all the rest of the posts and then from there I can sort by newest posts or most recent activity.
It‚Äôs terrible and unexpected app behavior. Group activity is the only reason I check Facebook throughout the day rather than just once at bedtime but now that Facebook is hiding that activity and making it so cumbersome to access the content I want, I‚Äôm using Reddit more often as a fast and easy way to engage with the content and people I want to instead of who an algorithm determines I should.",2
68,this is my most famous app i have a screen time on this app of 23 hours a day that‚Äôs show how much i love this app i like watching the the little kids get beat up my there moms,2
195,"I continuously see nudity and sexually explicit comments when reading the news on Facebook media pages. I‚Äôve repeatedly reported tons of it, but nothing is being done. When I check the status of my reports, it basically states that Facebook doesn‚Äôt have time to investigate. I don‚Äôt care to see that trash when reading the news. Facebook knows that most accounts being made are scammers and rule breakers but they don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs bad enough that at least half newsfeed items are ads, but we shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with obscenity. I enjoyed Facebook for many years but it seems their time in the sun has passed.",2
131,"Suddenly the in-app notifications have disappeared from my iPad app.  No, I‚Äôm not talking about push notifications, which is the only fix instruction offered on Google.  I‚Äôm talking about the badges at the bottom of the app when it is open.  I didn‚Äôt switch any settings or do any system updates‚Ä¶ just one day they weren‚Äôt there anymore.  So fun that there‚Äôs nobody at Facebook responding to my requests for help.",2
394,"They can dish it out but can‚Äôt take it coming back at them. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt even give you the option to rebut them.  They censor things they disagree with.  Their community standards are in fact laughable  double standards. You can‚Äôt appeal any of their decisions without jumping through hoops and speaking legalese only an attorney would know. Yet ask them to remove things from your feed for no apparent reason other than you don‚Äôt approve of it or just plain don‚Äôt want to see it and that‚Äôs not an option.  They think threatening you by blocking your content is actually a scary thing. They basically live in their own little fantasy world,
Making up their rules as they go along to suit their fancy. They hate words like Christianity, corporal punishment, death penalty, Jesus, Trump and traditional. One of these days, Zuckerberg‚Äôs money won‚Äôt get him out of HOT water.",2
185,"For the last two weeks you can‚Äôt get your notifications. I can see them on my phone notifications if they are tags or replies, but if I‚Äôm in Facebook I can‚Äôt see any new notifications. It‚Äôs shows me the ones from two weeks ago. And if I click on them so they aren‚Äôt highlighted, the next time I open the app they look new again. Ridiculous.",2

In order to force us to update the app under false ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù they slow down the app and make it non functional so you have to update so there are new ways they can shove ads at us in more ways than the previous update.

They make you jump through an incredible amount of hoops to get back into your account. You have to send in an ID, and take a selfie with a hand written number that they eventually send you. They made me takeThree different pictures with that stupid number. I kept getting a poorly written email saying that they needed to see more of my hands. How in the world are you supposed to see my hands if I‚Äôm taking a selfie?? They are idiots, the absolute only reason I even got back into my account is because of the groups that I am a part of.

Plus, you really should be able to tell where the product is coming from & allow people to expand on why an ad is spam or a scam.

And I always thought an opinion was exactly that .. an opinion is obviously not facts so what‚Äôs the point in fact checking an opinionated post ? I‚Äôm serious you guys . Facebook has continuously controlled and manipulated us to a point you shouldn‚Äôt think for yourself or is that not politically correct Facebook ? They have tracked all the things you do on your phone and for years they‚Äôve gathered information on us through what we thought was private .,2
63,"I get on Facebook about once a week and I also never post anything controversial because I don‚Äôt like to argue about important topics unless I‚Äôm face to face with someone. Well my facebook and Instagram account was permanently banned and not eligible for appeal. I had over 6,000 followers on Instagram and used it for my art. I also had an art business page for Facebook that I can‚Äôt even get into anymore. When I go to reset the password there is an email I don‚Äôt recognize so I think I got hacked somehow but how am I supposed to get help if I can‚Äôt even appeal it?",2
176,"I have been with Facebook for years three times Facebook disabled my page. I have written few objections regarding this unfairness decision. Also  instagram did the same two of my page‚Äôs disabled by instagram.
If you or Iranian the are working there without any doubt supporting this horrible regime. Most Iranian people aware of Facebook and instagram these actions are and it is against the human rights and free speech.
I am asking you to activate my accounts.",2
104,"I have never had such issues trying to open an account. I deleted my Facebook a few months ago because I didn‚Äôt want social media anymore, lost my job and needed Facebook but the 30 day grace period was up so I thought whatever I‚Äôll just make a new account. No. After 5 minutes on this new account, I was locked out, had to do a 3D screening of my face for a minute straight, and submit a photo of my ID. Never in my LIFE have I experienced this with a social media platform. Not to mention, trying to get help from Facebook is absolutely useless. Somebody better reinstate my account",2
70,I really love Facebook because it is better than instagram because instagram copied TikTok and that is how i meet friends from Facebook and I don‚Äôt have any issues so far,1
456,Never ending updates that create more glitches and more problems each time . It‚Äôs to the point groups are dead because members do not get notifications and people reached visibility is under 5% . I‚Äôm being tagged and still not getting the notifications. We have had 20 updates this year and we are only 15 weeks into 2023 ! Hasn‚Äôt been functioning properly in over a year !,2
33,"Meta is THE most unhelpful social media company. I tried logging into my FB account which I haven‚Äôt touched in years due to it no longer being a relevant or fun platform. Wanted to download a few older pics I had on there but was unable to log in. Tried to reset the password but it won‚Äôt send the link to an active email address. I no longer have the email I used way back when I made this account. There appears to be an option if you ‚Äúno longer have access to these‚Äù but nothing happens when you press this. Additionally there is no customer support to assist or any helpful option to help regain access to an active account. No wonder everyone hates Meta platforms and prefers newer, better social media like TikTok. What a joke of a company. Would give 0 stars if it were an option.",2
72,"I made a business page called Champions of Grace. I paid for ads that resulted in a huge number of bot comments. My posts weren‚Äôt showing up on a number of my friends feeds, despite paying for advertisements. Multiple ads I paid to run were denied due to political bias against the Christian views of my page.

 I was slandered by an article and attempted to pay for an ad that would disprove that article with factual evidence, but my ad was denied without valid justification and a vague and insufficient explanation. 

Facebook constantly fills my video feeds with borderline pornographic content. 
Facebook is absolutely horrible. I‚Äôd rather take my business elsewhere. 

‚ÄúIndependent fact checkers‚Äù prevented factual evidence from being dispersed about alternative treatments for COVID, and spread untruthful propaganda about the vaccine.

Facebook has become an arm of politics and tyranny.",2
78,"Why do you constantly have to keep changing how Facebook works. Those of us with older devices are dealing with the app no longer sending me notifications even though I didn‚Äôt change any of my settings! I posted in a group, and when I went back to see if anyone posted a comment there were 166! I did not receive a single notification‚Ä¶WTH!",2
0,"Upon opening the watch page, the first things I saw were extremely graphic in nature and clearly went against the ‚Äúcommunity guidelines‚Äù yet the content had been running live for hours. Reports do nothing. It disturbs me to think about how children could be stumbling upon stuff like this in the app, it‚Äôs terrible. Facebook provides nothing but bad things and wastes of time in that section of their app. The marketplace may be the only half-useful feature.",2
11,I was just recently hacked on my account and there is no way to report it because no matter what I try to do I still have to get into my account to even try and do anything to report it. My email and phone number were changed and I can‚Äôt get in at all to do anything!!!!,2
244,I think Facebook (FEMA) don‚Äôt understand what community standards is! All I did is clicking on going to the invitation for learning Understanding The Quran | Surah Al-Anfaal - Verses 15 to 21 | Dr kia Jahed (that I took screen shot for my proven fact) surprisingly Facebook giving me warning that I‚Äôm against community standards of hate speech??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ you need to fixed your system Facebook or go seek physiatrist and don‚Äôt forget to take your pills üíä üòÇüòÇüòÇ DO YOU KNOW WHAT a COMMUNITY STANDARDS IS???? Shame on you FACEBOOK üòÇüòÇüòÇ,2
22,"First it‚Äôs the non stop ads, then it‚Äôs suggested pages. It‚Äôs suggested pages that I have absolutely ZERO INTEREST IN. I have no option to remove them and I‚Äôm REALLY getting sick of seeing the same ones every single time clogging up my feed. Just when you think it can‚Äôt get any worse they do this. I really hate facebook and would delete it if it wasn‚Äôt for family on there.",2
408,My notification section has been completely scrambled the past few days which makes it impossible to keep up. I don‚Äôt have time to search through days worth of notifications to find the new one. This makes FB no longer convenient or useable. Lately I‚Äôve found in person communication and posters hanging more useful the FB. Clearly the world is going backwards which is probably a good thing.,2
460,"The number of ads I‚Äôm now seeing compared to posts that my friends are making is ridiculous. I just scrolled through my feed and had 5 ads before I saw ONE friend‚Äôs post, and the next post was another ad. This is FACEbook, not ADbook. I understand the need for ads, but that is the majority of my feed now. 

Also, to hide posts that are created in a PRIVATE group that people OPT in to being a part of because they contain trigger words such as ‚Äúsale‚Äù, ‚Äúdeal‚Äù, or anything related to selling an item needs to be fixed. I operate a private group and I can tell the difference in engagement when it‚Äôs related to a product vs a personal post. And yet, when I look at my newsfeed, it‚Äôs covered in ads that offer a similar product that I do with one being a knockoff brand of what I‚Äôm promoting. Just goes to show that Facebook promotes benefitting corporations over the individuals that utilize the service. If I‚Äôm looking for something specific, I will search for it. We don‚Äôt need Facebook telling us what we should buy.",2
519,"I‚Äôve recently gotten a new phone and i had to transfer everything over to it, this caused all of my apps to delete or log me out. Im trying to login to my account and i‚Äôve tried every password i have but it keeps saying ‚Äúerror‚Äù and when i try resetting my password it says the same thing. I can‚Äôt make a new account either due to the same exact reason. this is annoying, please fix your app.",2
82,"My Facebook account was hacked. While I was sleeping someone hacked my account, removed my phone number, changed the email and password. I receive 3 emails from Facebook to notify me, but they allowed them to change it anyway even though the request was coming from Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam. I tried the link ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù and to secure the account which was recommended but you can only do that if you have the email and password now on the hacked account. I tried the I‚Äôve been hacked link, the identity link, and every other possible link to try and gain access to my account but all roads lead to needing the email and password associated with the account. It won‚Äôt even let me notify them that my account was hacked. I‚Äôve sent countless emails to every possible Facebook support email, I‚Äôve watched countless Tube Videos. Nothing. So now I‚Äôm logged out, have no access, no help, lost thousands of pictures of my children, family and friends. Facebook, how is someone supposed to recover, secure or report a hacked account if you offer no other way to verify who you are other than the hackers email address and unknown password?!",2
493,Such a bad app that while I was playing my game I was about to score then it lagged because of friend request and it never stops even the ads come on I‚Äôm uninstalling the app that is recommended I‚Äôm telling all my family to dismissal the app now before they get mad with the app,2
347,"Not sure why, but this app doesn‚Äôt function well on iPad for those that want to create. No search, can‚Äôt look at trending sounds while trying to create. Thought it would be easier since I can actually see what I‚Äôm doing. Nope, not today.",2
18,These people want to upload my iD or Credit Card to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù my account even though I haven‚Äôt used it in 15 years they see me attempting to today as ‚Äúsuspicious activity‚Äù. With all the recent hacks and data leaks the company is plagued with I wouldn‚Äôt trust them watching my dog let alone my personal information. They want me to speedrun identity theft at this point.,2
180,There are no ways to get in contact with any customer service reps to help with recovery of an account that has been hacked. So much info is loaded in these sites and no way to contact anyone when it‚Äôs changed by someone else. If someone changes your email and phone number you have no way to recover or log in to your account.,2
228,What‚Äôs up with the new Notifications area on the app. It doesn‚Äôt go away when you see the notification and it never changes and keeps the old stuff up. This is the worst ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù made because it‚Äôs just annoying to think there‚Äôs a new notification and it‚Äôs just the same crap you‚Äôve seen 100+ times. Please take it back to the way it was or fix it with something better because it‚Äôs just annoy.,2
289,I Watch and post reels i don‚Äôt hardly ever even watch tv anymore regular tv is boring I love making reels and I love watching other people‚Äôs reels some are informative some are just funny,1
520,I been hacked twice an blocked but Facebook deletes you and no way to recover my Facebook account why ? I was sleeping as my page was hacked then blocked I wake up poof no more Facebook note right,2
39,"The only reason I remain on Facebook is to connect with old army buddies. I rarely post anything and it‚Äôs never something shared. A few days ago, Facebook kicked me off and I had to verify who I am. Weird but I didn‚Äôt really think anything of it. Last night I went to click on the comments on an article and I was sent to a page that informed me that I have been locked out of my account for possibly going against community standards. It allowed me to disagree and now I have to wait for it to be reviewed. There was no explanation whatsoever. The ‚Äúcommunity standards‚Äù that they push are such a joke anyway. I reported a picture that literally had a naked woman holding her breasts but was told that it didn‚Äôt go against their standards. I really just want my account unlocked so I can let my friends know how to reach me before I completely delete this trash.",2
471,"You guys really need to get ahold of all the fake accounts and spams. It has only gotten worse, and is starting to make the app to annoying to use. There are so many fake accounts trying to sell fake products and keeps showing more and more spams. I decided to delete this app because of how pathetic it‚Äôs gotten. I miss how Facebook used to be.",2
46,"Scrolling through my timeline with my phone brightness all the way down and in night mode, got blinded by the first reel video to pop up because it‚Äôs BRIGHTER than everything else on my screen. I didn‚Äôt click on the reel, I was scrolling through my timeline. Then BAM bright window of someone‚Äôs lame video just on my screen. I hate the fact that the reels even are on my timeline in the first place. But now they seemed to have ‚Äúhighlighted‚Äù them by making just the first video in the queue‚Äôs brightness brighter than the rest of my screen. That‚Äôs headache inducing and just annoying. I can‚Äôt even turn off the option. I won‚Äôt be using fb until that is fixed. My eyes are sensitive to screen brightness. I always keep my settings on low as possible, during all parts of the day.",2
479,"First, my account got hacked. So I scorched earthed it. Tried to create another account- it was immediately suspended because I was trying to make multiple accounts. No kidding! Disagreed with the decision. They wanted a 30 second facial recognition video‚Ä¶look right, look left, look up‚Ä¶do it again. Creepy! I felt so violated afterwards‚Ä¶like they had no intention of allowing a new account, they were just getting a video of my face to block me forever. Or something else. It was really, really odd and I didn‚Äôt like it one bit! Never been to Facebook jail, I trusted this platform before this! Never again! Just yuck!!!",2
211,"There are some misleading information in my profile that I keep trying to modify to ensure correctness, after I pressed save, the changes keep reverting back to the previous. I‚Äôd rather not get exposed to false information. Please fix the profile editing features. Otherwise it would be pointless for me to further use this media",2
414,"There are way too many ‚ÄúSuggested for you‚Äù posts, which makes it much harder to see posts from friends and family. An easy fix would be to allow users to turn off suggested posts, or snooze them like you can on Instagram. Of course Facebook also has much more systemic issues, especially with content moderation and misinformation, but the ‚ÄúSuggested for you‚Äù thing seems like a relatively simple thing to fix that would at least make Facebook useable.",2
495,"I know you have to pay for your product but always having to give a reason to remove an ad is ridiculous. Thought the update was supposed to help stop the crashes, well it didn‚Äôt. Not pleased with all the crashes. Guess this a sign to not use it so much.",2
287,For the most part people will get hacked into and for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt notify me or show me where the hacker posted things from my account. But since my email phone or other with my password is only for the use of Facebook that means that you sold my info out to someone and now is deciding to put me in Facebook restrictions,2
250,"I‚Äôve been trying to get in contact with Facebook for about 2 1/2 years. Somebody hacked my account and no one is not reaching out to me. I reached out to support groups and others, and no one is not reaching out to me. I have a business and I don‚Äôt not like those. My account hacked into my account. They change the password and they are pretending to be me and I will hope that Facebook will do something about this. My name is Nicole Jackson, a.k.a. nicole D jackson In My Wedding planne page is Wedding Planner Nicole Jackson E.N.T and if nothing does not happen soon I am looking into a lawyer and I‚Äôm going to sue Facebook for not responding to me respond to none of my request ‚Ä¶",2
490,"I see less and less of what my friends post and more and more of posts from big media (late night shows) and posts or ads by companies.

Also, every time I view a story, the volume goes right to max. I turn it down to min and the clip ends. I tap a new video (or short, or story, whatever it is) and the volume is back at max.

This is a great feature if I‚Äôm trying to annoy people in public spaces, but is super annoying to myself and my daughter when I‚Äôm scrolling and putting her down for a nap. 

I‚Äôll once again be deleting this app from my phone after I sell the few things on Facebook Marketplace I need to sell.

This app stinks worse than my daughter‚Äôs poops.",2
332,"My Facebook account was hacked into and taken over by someone else and sadly I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I had to create another account. The problem is that someone is using my Facebook page to advertise tons of items for sale and people think it‚Äôs me. I received an email message a few days ago that my password was changed from someone In Oklahoma. I have not been able to get it back because all the steps to reclaim my account involves providing info. that this person changed‚Ä¶ including my password, phone number, and email address. This is identity theft. My guess is that all these goods he is supposedly selling is only to get some money in advance.  I‚Äôm in South Carolina but was hacked from someone in Oklahoma. The problem is that it‚Äôs all under my name so many people think it‚Äôs me. I cannot even post anything on my own Facebook page with the exception of responding to what someone else may post; but I cannot comment on anything he post. This is ridiculous. There should be some way of getting my Facebook account back. This is identity fraud!!",2
220,Notifications are not showing in chronological order from most recent on top to oldest on bottom. Hard to find new notifications because they‚Äôre all mixed up.,2
321,I was able to pin a post of mine in my personal account just last wk. I wanted to switch it to something else & now it isn‚Äôt working! When I google to figure out why it tells me you can‚Äôt pin on your personal accounts. Only business. Idk how old that recourse is online but it‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶ because I just pinned something last wk. all I wanted to do was pin a different post & now that option is not available. Fix this asap,2
69,"I only have like 20 or so friends so my feed is constantly covered in sponsored videos and ads. It‚Äôs extremely annoying. I don‚Äôt want to see terrible LAD Bible, Buzzfeed, and Bored Panda videos of ‚Äúgood skills fix common problems‚Äù videos. I only have the app to keep track of birthdays and to use marketplace, but it‚Äôs really getting to the point where I‚Äôm just gonna close my account altogether.",2
472,"With the transition from what was originally Facebook to Meta, the platform is now nothing but a censorship circus. There is no actual appeal process if your account gets restricted since you aren‚Äôt able to respond except to agree or disagree with any Facebook moderator. And Zuckerberg, after laying off 11,000 employees, now admits they are understaffed and can‚Äôt even address members‚Äô issues with the company. Facebook would be well served with a new CEO like the recent Twitter deal.  
         Additionally, Facebook continues to show me repeat notifications, sometimes 3-4 times. You‚Äôll notice I gave the app a one star rating ‚Ä¶ only because less than one is not offered.",2
304,"This app is absolute garbage on the ipad. The videos in ‚Äúwatch‚Äù are always in ‚Äúdark mode‚Äù and you cant see what you type to comment. Also the videos automatically go into full screen mode if you move the ipad. I cannot find any way to adjust these if they are settings within the ipad app. I can see how to turn off ‚Äúdark mode‚Äù on the web page‚Ä¶but not the ipad app. And it doesnt seem to carry over from one to the other. The videos going into full screen just by moving the ipad is incredibly annoying.

How about making an update that fixes real issues rather trying to find ways to get more data out of us to sell!!!",2
286,"Facebook has gone to the dogs. To many ads, your marketplace is junk sometimes your posting the same thing 3 or 4 times on my feed, Plus your suggestions definitely are junk in plain english. 

Facebook use to a great place but your changes have sucked 
You don‚Äôt take the time to get to your people it‚Äôs ashamed get with the program Facebook",2
281,"I am so fed up with all of the crap that I have endured since I first started using the Facebook Marketplace. First off when you have purchase protection set up to ensure that we will receive exactly what we ordered or our money back and then resorting to doing that and on one order I never received and another order I received something totally different than I ordered and I reached out to the sellers and then filed a claim as stated and then no actions have been taken place I am still waiting on my refunds for these 2 orders and can‚Äôt get anyone to help me I am about ready to just file through the police station. This is just just mind-blowing how you can conduct business this way and expect to have good clientele and reviews. I will never recommend this app to anyone, and actually I will do just the opposite and tell them how you rip people off and don‚Äôt care.",2
