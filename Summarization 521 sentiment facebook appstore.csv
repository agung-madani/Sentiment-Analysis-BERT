Reports do nothing. It disturbs me to think about how children could be stumbling upon stuff like this in the app, it’s terrible.

3,"Long-time user who no longer posts on the platform, I was recently “suspended” from my account because my “behavior violated community standard rules”. Considering I don’t have any behavior to breaching rules, I found this questionable. To further this, when I contacted support for an explanation (I thought it possible that someone hacked my account and spammed my friend list, etc.), the support rep doubled down about my behavior violating community standard rules, and shared the community standard rules, but refused to disclose what exactly I (or my profile) did that warranted a suspension. It’d be funny, if it wasn’t so sad. The lack of transparency is alarming, and even if I were to regain access to my account, I likely will not be using it ever again.","To further this, when I contacted support for an explanation (I thought it possible that someone hacked my account and spammed my friend list, etc.",-1

116,Sooo I have sold on FB Marketplace for sometime. Was probably one of my favorite sites to sell. About a year ago I had a customer send a message about when I would be mailing her package. At the time I was a first responder and very busy but on the day of the message her package was placed in the mail. So when I messaged to notify the client she stated she had reported me because “I took to long to respond”. Upon trying to get on my account I was banned! I kept in contact with my client and I have all the messages stating she received her package and was delighted with the shoes. I never got paid and to this day my account is still banned. I appealed as many times as I could with no success and no reason as to why. You can’t talk to a human at all. I am so highly disappointed in the customer service of FB marketplace. I couldn’t even tell you how long the ban is for.

Despite these criticisms, the platform has seen significant success in the stock market and has provided substantial returns for investors.

506,"I've been using Facebook for many years now, and I've witnessed it evolve from a platform where I could easily connect with friends and family to what it has become today – an overwhelming ad-infested experience. I feel compelled to express my massive dissatisfaction with the current state of the platform.

It seems like every time I open Facebook, I'm bombarded with ads on every corner of the screen. I understand that ads are a part of the revenue model, but lately, it feels like they're taking up the majority of my feed. Instead of seeing updates from friends and family, I'm constantly being interrupted by sponsored posts and videos.

Navigating through the app has become such a chore, and it's incredibly frustrating to see my personal connections being drowned out by the relentless promotion of products and services. It's starting to feel more like a shopping channel than a social media platform.

I truly miss the days when Facebook was a simpler platform that prioritized social connections over profit. I hope that they'll take these concerns into consideration and find a better balance between user experience and ad revenue. Until then, I'm afraid my time on Facebook will be significantly reduced, and I'll be exploring other platforms for a more enjoyable social media experience.","Navigating through the app has become such a chore, and it's incredibly frustrating to see my personal connections being drowned out by the relentless promotion of products and services.",-1
507,"Since the last update, three days ago, the formatting does not fit my iPhone. If I click on a post, I can’t read it, I can just see the pictures. If I’m playing a game, links, I need to click at the bottom are off the bottom of the screen, and I can’t even see them. Please fix this.","If I click on a post, I can’t read it, I can just see the pictures.",-1
508,"It’s only a matter of time before Section 230 is repealed. It was a law created by Facebook Lobbyists who paid off congress so that social media apps couldn’t be sued. Then they baited creators to build fanbases on their platforms, and then stole the fan’s data sold the data to companies and used it for marketing. Then they cut off creators from their fans unless the creators paid to be seen. When the law is repealed there will be many class action lawsuits against Facebook and all of the apps that took advantage of creators.",Then they cut off creators from their fans unless the creators paid to be seen.,0
509,"Update: 
My amazing grandmother has passed away and my family and myself have tried for months to memorialize her account, but every single time it says there’s an error and it was unable to process request. We did everything it ask and show proof but it just doesn’t work. I’m done with this app.
Original review: 
 If I take a picture on Snapchat and upload it to Facebook the quality is horrible. It looks half decent if I upload it to Instagram first. Facebook destroys the quality of pictures and videos.","Original review:

510,"The app pushed you SO HARD to follow people, but going through your feed is %60 “content you may like” from accounts you don’t follow, %38 ADS, and %2 content from people you ACTUALLY follow. garbage. This app is just used to collect data to sell to other countries. If you’re gonna steal my data and sell it for profit, at least make sure your app is halfway decent.","If you’re gonna steal my data and sell it for profit, at least make sure your app is halfway decent.",-1
511,I make a post and Facebook decides if it can go viral amongst my friends. I post something positive and I get all the likes by my friends. I post something neutral and I get less than Half likes or support. I post something angry or don’t approve on a subject in life  and I get zero likes or acknowledge. Facebook is controlling to their own benefit and they became communism by the government and they for sure 100% are Democrat ran company. Sad we can’t speak our amendment rights and it doesn’t get spread to my friends the same way as any other post I create. Feels like a minimum wage detective personnel is pushing a button to reject your post from any friend to see it. I can get 85 likes on one post then the next I get Zero. 0 stars,I post something positive and I get all the likes by my friends.,-1

514,"Honestly I’m just tired of this app, between the numerous spam accounts that try to get you with EVERY share, accounts being hacked on a near weekly basis, videos and photos not showing even though you JUST shared them, the constant banning and shadow banning the moment you share a meme or show your opinion on something and now the latest and greatest of the app telling you somebody replied to your comment but it doesn’t bring you to the comment or the post at all and even IF you remember where that post that you commented is, half the time that comment (or yours) won’t even show at all. The only reason I’ve put up with all of this though is because half my friends and family can contact me on this app and this app alone.

517,I think they’re business model exploits human psychology but I need to buy a dresser for cheap and they also manage to monopolize sales by moving sales from the physical space to their retail space. They say you can choose to shop else where but what happens when good deals are all posted to Facebook for convenience? There are less sales to be made in retail space and other online forums.
